The Egg came first because paleontological and evolutionary evidence suggests it to have evolved from single cell organisms which develop a outer layer like cyst to protect itself from unfavourable conditions.
The chicken egg would have been a mutation of a species of proto-chicken resulting in a chicken.This would have occured over hundreds of years leading to speciation of the fittest species and other factors like genetic drift could have lead to the evolution of what is today's "chicken".
The egg of the proto-chicken would have come from a similar scenario, which indicates that the first multicellular organisms arised from unicellular ones, and thus, the Egg came first!
